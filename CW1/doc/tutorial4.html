<h1><a name="tutorial4">Tutorial 4: More Advanced Simulations</a>
</h1>In this tutorial we will look at some of the more advanced options available in creating new simulations. In particular:<ul>
<li>The GAVariant gene type and custom genes.</li><li>Creating more complex evolving animats.</li><li>Creating more complex worlds.</li><li>Creating more complex sensors.</li></ul>

The GAVariant Type</h2>
Supposing you want to run an evolutionary simulation using some genotype other than a simple list of values - perhaps your genes are a mixture of real values, integers and booleans, or perhaps they are some completely different type of your own devising. There are two options available to you in this situation:<ul>
<li>Create a mutation operator for your custom gene type and configure your Evolvers, Population and GeneticAlgorithm to use custom genes (specified in the Evolver template declaration) and your custom mutation operator. More information on this is available in the GeneticAlgorithm documentation.</li><li>For many simulations you will just need to be able to work with more than one of the basic types available in C++. This is where the GAVariant type comes in.</li></ul>
<p>
If you have programmed in BASIC, LISP or other high-level languages, you will already be familiar with the concept of a variant type. A variant is a data type which is able to act as a range of different types, performing conversions between them as required. A general purpose variant might allow you to add two strings containing numbers together and output the result as a float. GAVariant is simpler than this since it only deals with five basic types: int, double, float, char and bool.<h3><a name=""></a>
