<h1><a name="userguide">A short user's guide</a>
</h1>This guide explains briefly how to use the graphical interface to <a class="el" href="namespaceBEAST.html">BEAST</a>, and the commandline batch mode. These are currently the only interface options, although the library does provide scope for users to implement their own interfaces, e.g. an ActiveX interface allowing <a class="el" href="namespaceBEAST.html">BEAST</a> demos to run in web pages (I can dream!).<h2><a name="userguide_1"></a>
The Graphical User Interface</h2>
<h3><a name="userguide_1_0"></a>
Starting BEAST</h3>
To run the program, you need two things: the beast executable (called 'beast') and a plugin. Plugins are usually known as 'shared objects' to Linux users, or 'dynamically linked libraries' in Windows parlance. <a class="el" href="namespaceBEAST.html">BEAST</a> doesn't do anything at all without having at least one plugin loaded. Plugins have the extension '.so' on Linux or '.dll' on Windows and are produced automatically when you compile some <a class="el" href="namespaceBEAST.html">BEAST</a> code with the provided makefile. To get <a class="el" href="namespaceBEAST.html">BEAST</a> running a plugin called plugin.so, you would type:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>beast ./plugin.so
</pre></div><p>
assuming plugin.so is in your current directory.<h3><a name="userguide_1_1"></a>
Running simulations in the GUI</h3>
To start a simulation, go to the <em>File</em> menu and click on the simulation of your choice from a list of up to ten. The simulation should now start in the main window. Any log output (e.g. fitness scores) will appear in the log window below. Different elements may be displayed by toggling the options in the <em>View</em> menu, e.g. you can switch off the monitors, trails, collisions or even the animats.<p>
The simulation can be paused and reset in the <em>Simulation</em> menu. <em>High</em> <em>speed</em> mode can be selected from this menu or by pressing [space] in the main window. When high speed mode is activated, the simulation runs as fast as possible but does not update the display (except during screen redraws).<h3><a name="userguide_1_2"></a>
Interacting with the world</h3>
You can grab hold of anything which isn't fixed down, this includes all animats and any other objects which have their moveable property set to true. When you click on an object, it will usually display some information in the status bar and can also output information to the log window (programmers note: these are achieved with <a class="el" href="classBEAST_1_1WorldObject.html#a26">ToString </a> and <a class="el" href="">OnClick </a> respectively.)<p>
To change the orientation of the current grabbed object, while holding down with the left button, click and hold the right. You can now spin the object around by moving the mouse around the screen. Animats are not able to move while under the influence of the mouse pointer.<p>
Annoyingly, clicking on objects often leads to them being moved slightly which can adversely affect the simulation (it's the uncertainty principle at work again...). To avoid this, you can cycle through the animats by pressing tab and shift-tab to go backwards. (Programmers: in this case <a class="el" href="">OnSelect </a> is called.) This option is also available in the <em>World</em> menu.<h3><a name="userguide_1_3"></a>
Saving and loading</h3>
Depending on the simulation, groups of animats or objects may be saved and loaded through the <em>File</em> menu. When a population - that is, a group of animats which are being evolved using a GA - is saved, the parameters and history of the GA are saved with them, and the data stored usually corresponds to the genotypes of the population rather than the configuration of the Animats in the world. On reloading saved populations, the number of generations for that population will not be reflected in the status bar, but will appear in log window output. The reason for this is that if the number of generations registered by the simulation were linked to the number of generations for any given population in the simulation, things would cease to make sense when comparing different generations of two coevolved populations.<h2><a name="userguide_2"></a>
Batch mode</h2>
For long simulations the GUI is an unnecessary burden. Batch mode allows you to run simulations from the commandline without using the GUI. Batch mode only works for simulations with finite runs, generations, assessments and timesteps (programmers: the default is one run, infinite generations, 1 assessment and 1000 timesteps - change these from the constructors of your Simulation objects.)<p>
The syntax for running in batch mode is:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>beastbatch [plugin] [simname] [&lt;grpname&gt; &lt;filename&gt; ...]
</pre></div><p>
Where <code>plugin</code> is the name of your compiled simulation, <code>simname</code> is the name of the simulation you wish to run, as normally found in the <em>File</em> menu. You may optionally specify groups to be saved at the end of the simulation by including the name of the group (<code>grpname</code>) and a <code>filename</code> to save to. To save more than one group, include additional pairs at the end of the command.<p>
The only situation in which you won't want to specify group and file names on the commandline is if you have implemented your own code for saving results, or are only interested in the log output which will be redirected to standard out.<p>
An example commandline to run batch mode:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre>./demos -batch Chase Predators predators.pop Prey prey.pop
</pre></div><p>
Note that this won't work, since the supplied code has infinite generations, but hopefully you get the picture. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Sun Feb 1 21:26:34 2004 for BEAST - Bioinspired Evolutionary Agent Simulation Toolkit by
